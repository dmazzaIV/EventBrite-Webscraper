# EventBrite-Webscraper
Python web scraper using requests, Beautiful Soup4, and MySQL.
This is my contribution to a larger project for the class Design and Management of Software.
This script pulls all events from https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ca--san-jose/events/, which will be all events happening in the San Jose area on the EventBrite website. The script gets the event names, times, dates, locations, and descriptions and stores them in a SQL database using MySQL.
